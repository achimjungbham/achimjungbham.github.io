<h3>A &delta;-complete calculus for solving non-linear constraints</h3>
<p>Automated reasoning is at the core of many verification tasks and is widely used in industrial settings. I
will discuss difficulties solving non-linear constraints over transcendental functions, traditional approaches,
and in particular I will present the ksmt calculus, why it provides a \delta-complete procedure for that task
when functions are computable, potential extensions of it to other domains, as well as open problems in this
area.</p>
