  abstract = 	 {Quasicontinuity is a generalisation of Scott's notion of continuous
  domain, introduced in the early 80s by Gierz, Lawson and Stralka. In
  this paper we ask which cartesian closed full subcategories exist in
  ${\bf qCONT}$, the category of all quasicontinuous domains and
  Scott-continuous functions. The surprising, and perhaps
  disappointing, answer turns out to be that all such subcategories
  consist entirely of continuous domains. In other words, there are no
  new cartesian closed full subcategories in ${\bf qCONT}$ beyond those
  already known to exist in~${\bf CONT}$.

  To prove this, we reduce the notion of meet-continuity for dcpos to
  one which only involves well-ordered chains. This allows us to
  characterise meet-continuity by ``forbidden substructures''. We then
  show that each forbidden substructure has a non-quasicontinuous
  function space.\\
  {\bf Keywords:} cartesian closed category; quasicontinuous domain;
  meet-continuity; meet$^{*}$-continuity}
