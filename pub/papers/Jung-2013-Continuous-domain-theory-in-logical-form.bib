  abstract = 	 {In 1987 Samson Abramsky presented \emph{Domain Theory in Logical
    Form} in the \emph{Logic in Computer Science} conference. His
  contribution to the conference proceedings was honoured with the
  \emph{Test-of-Time} award 20 years later. In this note I trace a
  particular line of research that arose from this landmark paper, one
  that was triggered by my collaboration with Samson on the article
  \emph{Domain Theory} which was published as a chapter in the
  \emph{Handbook of Logic in Computer Science} in 1994.}
