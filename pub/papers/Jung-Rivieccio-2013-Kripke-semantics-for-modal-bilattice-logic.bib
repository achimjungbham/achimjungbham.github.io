  abstract = 	 {We employ the well-developed and powerful techniques of
  \emph{algebraic semantics} and \emph{Priestley duality} to set up a
  Kripke semantics for a modal expansion of Arieli and Avron's
  \emph{bilattice logic}, itself based on Belnap's four-valued logic.
  We obtain soundness and completeness of a Hilbert-style derivation
  system for this logic with respect to four-valued Kripke frames, the
  standard notion of model in this setting. The proof is via
  intermediary relational structures which are analysed through a
  topological reading of one of the axioms of the logic.  Both local
  and global consequence on the models are covered.}
