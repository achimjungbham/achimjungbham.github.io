  abstract = 	 {Dcpos can be presented by preorders of generators
                  and inequational relations expressed as covers.
                  Algebraic operations on the generators (possibly
                  with their results being ideals of generators) can
                  be extended to the dcpo presented, provided the
                  covers are “stable” for the operations. The
                  resulting dcpo algebra has a natural universal
                  characterization and satisfies all the inequational
                  laws satisfied by the generating algebra.
                  Applications include known “coverage theorems” from
                  locale theory.}
