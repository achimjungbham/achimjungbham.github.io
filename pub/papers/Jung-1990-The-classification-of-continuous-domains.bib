  abstract = 	{The long-standing problem of finding the maximal
		  cartesian closed categories of continuous domains is
		  solved. The solution requires the definition of a
		  new class of continuous domains, called {\em
		  FS-domains}, which contains all retracts of
		  SFP-objects. The properties of FS-domains are
		  discussed in some detail.}
