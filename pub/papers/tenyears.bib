  abstract = 	 {In this collection we try to give an overview of some
                 selected topics in Domain Theory and Denotational
                 Semantics. In doing so, we first survey the mathematical
                 universes which have been used as semantic domains. The
                 emphasis is on those ordered structures which have been
                 introduced by Dana Scott in 1969 and which figure under
                 the name (Scott-) domains. After surveying developments in
                 the concrete theory of domains we describe two newer
                 developments, the axiomatic and the synthetic approach. In
                 the second part we look at three computational phenomena
                 in detail, namely, sequential computation, polymorphism,
                 and mutable state, and at the challenges that these pose
                 for a mathematical model.
