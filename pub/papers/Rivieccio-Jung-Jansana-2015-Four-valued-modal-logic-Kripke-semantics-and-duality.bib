  abstract = 	 {We introduce a family of modal expansions of
                  Belnap-Dunn four-valued logic and related systems,
                  and interpret them in many-valued Kripke structures.
                  Using algebraic logic techniques and topological
                  duality for modal algebras, and generalizing the
                  so-called twist-structure representation, we
                  axiomatize by means of Hilbert-style calculi the
                  least modal logic over the four-element Belnap
                  lattice and some of its axiomatic extensions. We
                  study the algebraic models of these systems,
                  relating them to the algebraic semantics of
                  classical multi-modal logic. This link allows us to
                  prove that both local and global consequence of the
                  least four-valued modal logic enjoy the finite model
                  property and are therefore decidable.}
