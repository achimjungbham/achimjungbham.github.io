  abstract = 	 {We put forward a revised definition of \emph{stably compact
      spaces} which allows us to show their equivalence with Nachbin's
    \emph{compact ordered spaces} in an entirely elementary fashion.
    We then exhibit some constructions for stably compact spaces which
    apparently have not appeared in the literature before. These
    constructions allow us to show that the set of (sub-)probability
    valuations can be equipped with a topology which turns this set
    into another stably compact space. The topology chosen is not
    random; it is the weakest topology which makes integration of
    lower semicontinuous functions a continuous operation.}
