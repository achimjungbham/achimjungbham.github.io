  abstract = 	 {We study a Gentzen style sequent calculus where the
		  formulas on the left and right of the turnstile need
		  not necessarily come from the same logical system.
		  Such a sequent can be seen as a consequence between
		  different domains of reasoning. We discuss the
		  ingredients needed to set up the logic generalized
		  in this fashion.

  		  The usual cut rule does not make sense for sequents
		  which connect different logical systems because it
		  mixes formulas from antecedent and succedent. We
		  propose a different cut rule which addresses this
		  problem.

  		  The new cut rule can be used as a basis for
		  composition in a suitable category of logical
		  systems. As it turns out, this category is
		  equivalent to coherent spaces with certain relations
		  between them.
		  
		  Finally, cut elimination in this set-up can be
		  employed to provide a new explanation of the domain
		  constructions in Samson Abramsky's Domain
		  Theory in Logical Form.}
