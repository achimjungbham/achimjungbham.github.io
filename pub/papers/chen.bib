  abstract = 	 {Building on earlier work by Guo-Qiang Zhang on disjunctive
  information systems, and by Thomas Ehrhard, Pasquale Malacaria, and
  the first author on stable Stone duality, we develop a framework of
  disjunctive propositional logic in which theories correspond to
  algebraic L-domains. Disjunctions in the logic can be indexed by
  arbitrary sets (as in geometric logic) but must be provably
  disjoint. This raises several technical issues which have to be
  addressed before clean notions of axiom system and theory can be
  defined.
  
  We show soundness and completeness of the proof system with respect
  to distributive disjunctive semilattices, and prove that every such
  semilattice arises as the Lindenbaum algebra of a disjunctive
  theory. Via stable Stone duality, we show how to use disjunctive
  propositional logic for a logical description of algebraic
  L-domains.}
