  abstract = 	 {We develop a Priestley-style duality theory for different classes of
  algebras having a bilattice reduct. A similar investigation has already
  been realized by B.~Mobasher, D.~Pigozzi, G.~Slutzki and G.~Voutsadakis,
  but only from an abstract category-theoretic point of view. In the
  present work we are instead interested in a concrete study of the
  topological spaces that correspond to bilattices and some related
  algebras that are obtained through expansions of the algebraic language.}
