  abstract = 	 {We present a Stone duality for bitopological spaces in analogy to
  the duality between topological spaces and frames, and discuss the
  resulting notions of sobriety and spatiality. Under the additional
  assumption of regularity, we prove a characterisation theorem for
  subsets of a bisober space that are compact in one and closed in the
  other topology. This is in analogy to the celebrated Hofmann-Mislove
  theorem for sober spaces. We link the characterisation to Taylor's
  and Escard{\'o}'s reading of the Hofmann-Mislove theorem as continuous
  quantification over a subspace. As an application, we define locally
  compact d-frames and show that these are always spatial.}
