  abstract = 	{We study continuous lattices with maps which preserve all 
                 suprema rather than only directed ones. We introduce the 
                 (full) subcategory of FS-lattices which turns out to be 
                 $*$-autonomous, and in fact maximal with this property. 
                 FS-lattices are studied in the presence of distributivity 
                 and algebraicity. The theory is extremely rich with numerous
                 connections to classical Domain Theory, complete
                 distributivity, Topology, and models of Linear Logic.}
