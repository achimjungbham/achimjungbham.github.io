  abstract = 	{We enrich the $*$-autonomous category of complete
		  lattices and maps preserving all suprema with the
		  important concept of {\em approximation\/} by
		  specifying a $*$-autonomous full subcategory LFS of
		  {\em linear FS-lattices\/}. This is the greatest
		  $*$-autonomous full subcategory of linked
		  bicontinuous lattices. The modalities ! and ?
		  mediate a duality between the upper and
		  lower powerdomains. The distributive objects in LFS
		  give rise to the {\em compact closed\/}
		  $*$-autonomous full subcategory CD of {\em
		  completely distributive lattices\/}. We characterize
		  algebraic objects in LFS by forbidden substructures
		  `\`a la Plotkin'.}
