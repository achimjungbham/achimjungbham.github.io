  abstract = 	 {We sharpen the notion of a quasi-uniform space to
		  spaces which carry with them functional means of
		  approximating points, opens and compacts. Assuming
		  nothing but sobriety, the requirement of uniform
		  approximation induces that such spaces are compact
		  ordered (in the sense of Nachbin). We study
		  uniformly approximated spaces with the means of
		  topology, uniform topology, order theory and locale
		  theory. In each case it turns out that one can give
		  a succinct and meaningful characterization. This
		  leads us to believe that uniform approximation is
		  indeed a concept of central importance.}
