  abstract = 	 { Stably compact spaces are a natural generalization of compact
 Hausdorff spaces in the $T_0$ setting. They have been studied
 intensively by a number of researchers and from a variety of
 standpoints.

 In this paper we let the morphisms between stably compact spaces be
 certain ``closed relations'' and study the resulting categorical
 properties. Apart from extending ordinary continuous maps, these
 morphisms have a number of pleasing properties, the most prominent,
 perhaps, being that they correspond to preframe homomorphisms on the
 localic side. We exploit this Stone-type duality to establish that
 the category of stably compact spaces and closed relations has
 bilimits.}
