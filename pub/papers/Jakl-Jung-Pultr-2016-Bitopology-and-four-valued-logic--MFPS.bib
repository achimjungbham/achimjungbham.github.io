abstract = 	 {Bilattices and d-frames are two different kinds of structures with a
  four-valued interpretation. Whereas d-frames were introduced with
  their topological semantics in mind, the theory of bilattices has a
  closer connection with logic. We consider a common generalisation of
  both structures and show that this not only still has a clear
  bitopological semantics, but that it also preserves most of the
  original bilattice logic. Moreover, we also obtain a new
  bitopological interpretation for the connectives of four-valued
  logic.}
