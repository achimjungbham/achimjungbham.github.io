  abstract = 	{It is a pleasant fact that Stone-duality may be
		  described very  smoothly when restricted to the
		  category of compact spectral spaces: The
		  Stone-duals of these spaces, arithmetic algebraic
		  lattices, may  be replaced by their sublattices of
		  compact elements thus discarding infinitary
		  operations.

  		  We present a similar approach to describe the
		  Stone-duals of coherent spaces, thus dropping the
		  requirement of having a base of compact-opens (or,
		  alternatively, replacing algebraicity of the
		  lattices by continuity). The construction via
		  \emph{strong proximity lattices} is resembling the
		  classical case, just replacing the order by an
		  \emph{order of approximation.}

  		  Our development enlightens the fact that ``open''
		  and ``compact'' are dual concepts which merely
		  happen to coincide in the classical case.}
