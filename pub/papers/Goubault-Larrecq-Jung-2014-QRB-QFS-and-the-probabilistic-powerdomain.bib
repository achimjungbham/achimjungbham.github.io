  abstract = 	 {We show that the first author's QRB-domains coincide with Li and
  Xu's QFS-domains, and also with Lawson-compact quasi-continuous
  dcpos, with stably-compact locally finitary compact spaces, with
  sober QFS-spaces, and with sober QRB-spaces.  The first three
  coincidences were discovered independently by Lawson and Xi.  The
  equivalence with sober QFS-spaces is then applied to give a novel,
  direct proof that the probabilistic powerdomain of a QRB-domain is a
  QRB-domain.  This improves upon a previous, similar result, which was
  limited to pointed, second-countable QRB-domains.}
