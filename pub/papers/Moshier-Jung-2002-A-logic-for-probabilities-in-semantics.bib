  abstract = {Probabilistic computation has proven to be a challenging
and interesting area of research, both from the theoretical
perspective of denotational semantics and the practical perspective of
reasoning about probabilistic algorithms. On the theoretical side, the
probabilistic powerdomain of Jones and Plotkin represents a
significant advance. Further work, especially by Alvarez-Manilla, has
greatly improved our understanding of the probabilistic powerdomain,
and has helped clarify its relation to classical measure and
integration theory. On the practical side, many researchers such as
Kozen, Segala, Desharnais, and Kwiatkowska, among others, study
problems of verification for probabilistic computation by defining
various suitable logics for the classes of processes under study. The
work reported here begins to bridge the gap between the domain
theoretic and verification (model checking) perspectives on
probabilistic computation by exhibiting sound and complete logics for
probabilistic powerdomains that arise directly from given logics for
the underlying domains.

The category in which the construction is carried out generalizes
Scott's Information Systems by taking account of full classical
sequents. Via Stone duality, following Abramsky's Domain Theory in
Logical Form, all known interesting categories of domains are embedded
as subcategories. So the results reported here properly generalize
similar constructions on specific categories of domains. The category
offers a promising universe of semantic domains characterized by a
very rich structure and good preservation properties of standard
constructions. Furthermore, because the logical constructions make use
of full classical sequents, the morphisms have a natural
non-deterministic interpretation. Thus the category is a natural one
in which to investigate the relationship between probabilistic and
non-deterministic computation. We discuss the problem of integrating
probabilistic and non-deterministic computation after presenting the
construction of logics for probabilistic powerdomains.}
