  abstract = 	 {This paper reviews the one-to-one correspondence between stably
  compact spaces (a topological concept covering most classes of
  semantic domains) and compact ordered Hausdorff spaces. The
  correspondence is extended to certain classes of real-valued
  functions on these spaces. This is the basis for transferring
  methods and results from functional analysis to the non-Hausdorff
  setting.
  
  As an application of this, the Riesz Representation Theorem is used
  for a straightforward proof of the (known) fact that every valuation
  on a stably compact space extends uniquely to a Radon measure on the
  Borel algebra of the corresponding compact Hausdorff space.

  The view of valuations and measures as certain linear functionals on
  function spaces suggests considering a weak topology for the space
  of all valuations. If these are restricted to the probabilistic or
  sub-probabilistic case, then another stably compact space is
  obtained. The corresponding compact ordered space can be viewed as
  the set of (probability or sub-probability) measures together with
  \emph{their} natural weak topology.}
