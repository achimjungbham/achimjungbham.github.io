  abstract = 	{The problem of decomposing domains into sensible
		  factors is addressed and solved for the case of
		  dI-domains. A decomposition theorem is proved which
		  allows the represention of a large subclass of
		  dI-domains in a product of flat domains. Direct
		  product decompositions of Scott-domains are studied
		  separately.}
