  abstract = 	 {In \cite{jones90} it is shown that the probabilistic
		  powerdomain of a continuous domain is again
		  continuous. The category of continuous domains,
		  however, is not cartesian closed, and one has to
		  look at subcategories such as $\cat{RB}$, the
		  retracts of bifinite domains. \cite{graham88} offers
		  a proof that the probabilistic powerdomain
		  construction can be restricted to~$\cat{RB}$. 

		  In this paper, we give a counterexample to Graham's
		  proof and describe our own attempts at proving a
		  closure result for the probabilistic powerdomain
		  construction. We have positive results for finite
		  trees and finite reversed trees. These illustrate
		  the difficulties we face, rather than being a
		  satisfying answer to the question of whether the
		  probabilistic powerdomain and function spaces can be
		  reconciled. 

  		  We are more successful with coherent or
		  Lawson-compact domains. These form a category with
		  many pleasing properties but they fall short of
		  supporting function spaces. 

  		  Along the way, we give a new proof of Jones'
		  Splitting Lemma.}
