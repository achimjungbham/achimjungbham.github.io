<h3>The Birmingham Theory Group</h3>

<p>Our work concerns the development and study of precise mathematical formalisms that can be employed for the design, specification, and verification of computer programs. This is in a tradition of mathematical semantics that was started in the UK in the 1960s by Peter Landin, Christopher Strachey, and Dana Scott. This kind of semantics encompasses many mathematical theories, foremost among them order theory, topology, logic, game theory, and category theory, all of which feature in the work of the Birmingham Theory Group. It is the rich and often surprising interplay between these mathematical areas and programming concerns that gives rise to opportunities for deep and profound research.</p>

<li>direct topological arguments for proving higher-order programs correct: Escardo, Ho: <b>Operational domain theory and topology of a sequential programming language</b>.  <em>20th Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science</em>, 2005.
<li>categorical structure of effectful computation: Staton, Levy: <b>Universal properties for impure programming languages</b>. </em>Fortieth ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages</em>, 2013.
</ul>

<p>One of the most fascinating aspects of our work is that the mathematical theories we explore have found interest and application beyond the realm of semantics. A prime example of this is the link between type theory and homotopy theory which shows promise to provide a new constructive foundation for mathematics. Similarly, work in abstract category theory, originally developed with applications in computing in mind, is now being deployed for a new foundation of quantum physics.</p>

<p>We are co-founders of the <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/MGS/">Midlands Graduate School in the Foundations of Computing Science<a> which has introduced more than 400 phd students and researchers to foundational and advanced topics in mathematical semantics, and have participated in many similar events worldwide.</p>

<p>The Group runs twice-weekly lab sessions and a weekly seminar series with speakers from the UK and beyond.</p>
