<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>Squeeze the lemon and mix the juice with about 2 cups of water. Zest the lemon rind and add that, too.</p><p>Use a cloth to remove the fluff from the quinces. No further washing is required. Cut the quinces into eights and remove cores. Often some of the flesh is discoloured - this is normal and doesn't need to be removed. Important: do not peel the quinces! Put the quince pieces into the lemon water quickly to stop oxydization, though there is not enough water to cover them all.</p><p>Put everything into a pressure cooker and cook at high pressure for 5 to 7 minutes. If you use a high-temperature setting on your stove, then it's likely that the quinces will burn at the bottom of the pot, so be more gentle (setting of 7 seems to work). If you don't have a pressure cooker, then use a normal pot (with a good lid) and cook for 30-40 minutes.</p><p>At the end of the cooking time, the quinces should be very soft and easy to blitz into a mash with the hand blender. Strain through a fine (!) sieve to remove any remaining fibres.<br>Weigh the pulp and put it into a jam pot. Bring to a boil (gently again and stirring often or it will stick to the bottom of the pan) and add the same amount of sugar into which you have stirred the pectin powder. Bring to a good boil (stirring all the time) and wait until you have obtained the right consistency and it starts to set. This should take no more than 10 minutes.</p><p>Fill into jam jars, close them with a lid, and turn upside down for a few minutes. Then turn them upright again and check that the lid has completely sealed the jar.</p><p>Alternatively, some of the jam can be spread on a baking sheet and dried in a warm oven (about 50 deg C) for a few hours to obtain membrillo. If that's your primary aim then you don't need any pectin.</p></div></div></div>
