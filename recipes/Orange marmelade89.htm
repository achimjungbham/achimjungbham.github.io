<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>Wash the oranges and lemons, dry them and cut in half. Squeeze all juice from them and collect the pith into a pressure cooker. Discard the seeds. </p><p>Cut the orange and lemon peel once more and add to the pressure cooker. Pour in the water. Check that the peels are covered and if not, add some of the orange juice. Put on the lid and cook at high pressure for 7 minutes.</p><p>After the pressure has gone down, open the cooker, fish out the orange pieces  and place them on a baking sheet so that they cool down quickly. Discard the lemon peels. Blitz the water with the pith with a hand blender, then pour into a fine sieve (possibly in batches). With the help of a spoon, strain the pith as best as you can, so that you get as much pulp as possible and only the hard and stringly bits remain in the sieve. </p><p>Finely slice the orange peels. Mix pectin with the sugar. Check that you have 2 litres of liquid overall.</p><p>Place everything into a jam pan, stir to dissolve the sugar, and bring to a boil. Boil at high heat for about 45 minutes or until setting point is reached (104.5 deg C). You will probably want to add more sugar as the marmelade gets more intense from the cooking. If you have added too much sugar, use some citric acid to balance the sweetness.</p><p>Fill into jam jars, close them tightly and put them upside-down onto the worktop. After about 10 minutes, turn them over and let cool.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>Don't be tempted to make a larger quantity in one go. If you have more oranges, then prepare in batches of the maximum quantity given here.</p></div></div>
