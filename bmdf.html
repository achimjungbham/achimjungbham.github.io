          </h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Bilattices and frames are
            mathematical structures widely applied in Theoretical
            Computer Science, although in quite different areas. <br>
            <br>
            Bilattices were introduced within the context of
            non-monotonic and paraconsistent reasoning in Artificial
            Intelligence, while frames have a key role in Domain Theory,
            the mathematical theory of computation introduced by Dana
            Scott as a foundation for denotational semantics of
            programs. <br>
            <br>
            The introduction of d-frames, a generalization of frames
            designed to handle partial and conflicting information, has
            recently opened a way to combine these two formalisms. <br>
            <br>
            The aim of the present proposal is to explore this
            possibility in order to obtain a mathematically rigorous and
            versatile formalism that unifies the approach of bilattices
            and the one of d-frames, thus having a primary impact on
            Domain Theory but also on bilattice-based formalisms. <br>
            <br>
            This is to be accomplished, on the one hand, by applying the
            algebraic and logical methods that proved to be successful
            in the study of bilattices to the theory of d-frames, with
            the main aim to develop and achieve a deeper understanding
            of the logic underlying d-frames; on the other hand, by
            extending the scope of bilattices to the setting of Domain
            Theory, focusing on issues such as completeness and
            topological duality.<br>

              <span style="font-weight: bold;">November - December</span>.
              As a first step toward a (bi)topological understanding of
              bilattices, we have developed a Priestley-style
              topological duality theory for different classes of
              bilattices (with and without negation, implication,
              conflation operators). UR has given a presentation based
              on this work at the <span style="font-style: italic;">TACL


                2011</span> conference (<span style="font-style:
                italic;">Topology, Algebra, and Categories in Logic</span>)
              and an invited seminar at Analytic Topology in Mathematics
              and Computer Science Seminar of the University of Oxford
              (UK). This research has also resulted in a paper (1) to
              appear on <span style="font-style: italic;">Studia Logica</span>.<span

            <li>2012<br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">January - February</span>:
              During this period Prof Ramon Jansana from the University
              of Barcelona (Spain), one of the collaborators mentioned
              in the project, hes been visiting the University of
              Birmingham.&nbsp; Together with Prof Jansana we have
              started the study of modal operators on bilattices. This
              line of research is related to our previous investigation
              of topological spaces corresponding to bilattices, as
              there is a natural way of associating topological spaces
              to the structures used in Kripke-style semantics for modal
              logics. This seems to be a promising line of research, as
              the applications of modal operators within computer
              science are constantly growing. Some preliminary results
              obtained in this respect have been presented by UR in an
              invited presentation at the <span style="font-style:
                italic;">CLOG Seminar </span>of the University of
              Leicester (UK).<br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">March - April</span>: UR
              has extended his investigation of modal operators on
              bilattices to related algebras, called <span
                style="font-style: italic;">twist-structures,</span>
              which correspond to subreducts (i.e., subalgebras relative
              to a fragment of the algebraic language) of certain
              classes of bilattices. This work, partly carried out in
              collaboration with Prof Hiroakira Ono (Japan Advanced
              Institute of Science and Technology)<span
                style="font-style: italic;"> </span>resulted in a joint
              paper, submitted to a special issue of <span
                style="font-style: italic;">Studia Logica</span> devoted
              to Non-classical Modal and Predicate Logics.<span
                style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">May - June</span>: We
              have continued our exploratory study of modal operations
              on bilattices. Some results on this have been presented by
              UR in an invited talk at <span style="font-style:
                italic;">Algebra|Coalgebra Seminar</span> of the
              Institute for Logic, Language &amp; Computation (ILLC) in
              Amsterdam. This line of research has been further pursued
              by UR during a research stay at the University of
              Barcelona, in collaboration with Prof Ramon Jansana and Dr
              F??lix Bou, within the more general context of many-valued
              modal logics. UR presented related work on
              twist-structures at the <span style="font-style: italic;">Duality


                Theory in Algebra, Logic and Computer Science Workshop 1
              </span>(University of Oxford) and at the <span
                style="font-style: italic;">Trends in Logic XI</span>
              international conference in Germany.<br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">July - August</span>: We
              have been studying bilattice-valued modal logics from two
              parallel perspectives: (1) from the point of many-valued
              modal logics, continuing along the line of the research
              started in collaboration with Prof Jansana and Dr Bou in
              Barcelona, succeeding in aximatizing the least modal logic
              over the four-element Belnap bilattice; (2) from a more
              general coalgebraic point of view, aiming at extending the
              framework of coalgebraic modal logic from the classical to
              the bilattice setting. This last line of research has been
              pursued in collaboratio with Prof Jung's doctoral student
              Liang-Ting Chen. UR presented some general results on the
              application of bilattice logics in computer science at the
              <span style="font-style: italic;">15th Wessex Theory
                Seminar </span>(University of Birmingham).<br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">September - October</span>:
              UR continued research on <span style="font-style:
                italic;">implicative twist-structures</span> (i.e.,
              twist-structures corresponding to somehow minimal
              subreducts of bilattices) during a research stay at the
              Japan Advanced Institute for Science and Technology
              (JAIST, Japan) in collaboration with Prof Hiroakira Ono.
              Some results from this work have been presented by UR at
              the <span style="font-style: italic;">Logic, Algebra and
                Truth Degrees </span>2012 international conference
              (Kanazawa, Japan). Parallel to this line of research, we
              have continued the investigation of modal operators on
              bilattices, achieving some first results on the
              undertanding of modal bilattice logics from a coalgebraic
              point of view and obtaining an algebraic completeness
              theorem and a topological representation for modal
              bilattice logics and the associated algebraic semantics.<br>
